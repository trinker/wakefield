Versioning
----------

Releases will be numbered with the following semantic versioning format:

<major>.<minor>.<patch>

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor
  and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor
  (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch


wakefield 0.3.6
----------------------------------------------------------------

* A maintenence release to address stringi's change in `lorem_ipsum()`.


wakefield 0.3.3
----------------------------------------------------------------

* A maintenence release to ensure that images for README are accessible per CRAN's
  request.



wakefield 0.2.1
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* `year` used `hijack` to hard code the year into the documentation causing
  a mismatch in the function arguments and documentation on Jan. 1st.  `hijack`
  is no longer used to create `year`.

* `likert` had a space at the end of the `"Strongly Agree "` group.  This has
  been stripped.

* `political` had the wrong distribution of political groups.  This has been
  fixed.

wakefield 0.2.0
----------------------------------------------------------------

IMPROVEMENTS

* Added clarification to `groups` to indicate its binary grouping and alternate
  grouping for > 2 groups (see issue #5).


wakefield 0.1.0
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* `employment` was misspelled as `empoyment`.  Caught by Danilo Freire (issue #2).

* `r_list` did not handle vectors and data.frames that were passed to it.  The
  symbols were turned into calls before they were tested as vector/data.frame.

* `rep.sep` was not honored in `r_data_frame` ("_" was used).

NEW FEATURES

* `r_list` & `r_data_frame` now add a suffix to repeat variable names in a
  sensible way.  The separator is controlled by `rep.sep`.  Suggested by
  Ananda Mahto.  See issue #1 for details.

* `r_list` and `r_data_frame` can utilize `r_series` and `r_dummy` to produce
  series of variables. Suggested by Ananda Mahto.  See issue #1 for details.

* `r_series` added to produce a series of grouped data.  This is useful for
  simulating repeated measures or survey questions.  Suggested by Ananda Mahto.
  See issue #1 for details.

* `r_series` picks up a `reate argument to generate related data as suggested by
  Wordpress user Ulf: http://goo.gl/H1RKsV.

* `as_integer` added as a means of coercing all columns of a `factor`
  `data.frame` to `integer`s.

* `r_dummy` added to produce multiple dummy columns from a single factor.

* `dob` and `birth` functions added for date of birth variable function.

* `military` added as a random military branch varaible function.

* `religion` added as a random religion varaible function.

* `internet_browser` added as a random Internet browser varaible function.

* `peek` added to allow a truncated head inspection of all columns of a
  `data.frame`.

* `table_heat` & `plot.tbl_df` added to visualize column types & `NA`s.

* `r_insert` added to safely insert `data.frame`s into a `r_data_frame` or
  `r_list` object.

* `variables` added to view the available variable functions.

* `p_data_theme` added to "save" common themes (preset column types).

* `relate` function added to generate related data as suggested by Wordpress
  user Ulf: http://goo.gl/H1RKsV.

* `sex_inclusive` and `gender_inclusive` added to give a non-binary alternative
  for sex/gender variables that are more inclusive.  Thanks to Matthew Sigal
  for this https://github.com/trinker/wakefield/pull/4.

MINOR FEATURES

* `seriesname` function added to give a `data.frame` an attribute `seriesname`.
  Typicaly this is for internal use.
